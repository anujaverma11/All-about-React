/*
1. JS File loaded by browser
2. App component gets created
3. We call geolocation service - getting this result take some time.
4. App returns JSX, gets rendered to page as HTML - With functions we dont have any good way of rendering the latitude on the page as the location is taking time and app already returned the component.
5. We get results of geolocation

Rules of Class Components
 - Must be A Javascript Class
 - Must extend (subclass) React.Component
 - Must define a 'render' method that returns some amount of JSX
