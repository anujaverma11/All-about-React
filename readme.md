React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. It is also considered as 'V' in MVC.
React was built to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time.

Why React?

- React is compose-able, so the application is broken down in small pieces of reusable components or module
- React interacts with a virtual DOM and eliminates the concept of DOM manipulation
- React syntax is declarative it updates the view as you code.
