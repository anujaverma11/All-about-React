##### Why React?
- React is a Javascript Library.
- React helps in building large application with the data changing overtime.
- When data changes react simple hit "refresh" button and only update the changed parts.
- React is all about building reusable components.

###### Imperative vs Declarative Code
- Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. An imperative programming language uses a sequence of statements to determine how to reach a certain goal. These statements are said to change the state of the program as each one is executed in turn. You are telling your code how to do something. Examples of Imperative programming languages is Java.

- Declarative programming is when you write your code in such a way that it describes what you want to do, and not how you want to do it. It is left up to the compiler to figure out the how. Examples of declarative programming languages are SQL and Prolog.






##### Why Gulp?
- Gulp is a build System.
- Can compress and concatenate javascript files.

To compile all the code from JSX to javascript we use a build system called Gulp. Gulp is a node based package. to install gulp we need 'npm'. For this example we will use gulp-react and gulp-concatenate.

##### What Browserify do?
Browserify lets you require('modules') in the browser by bundling up all of your dependencies. We need Browserify, as In react we put each component into each module.


##### What is JSX?

JSX Extenstion of Javascript. It allows you to write HTML inside your Javascript code. JSX must first be compiled from JSX to Javascript.
